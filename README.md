# Augmented Reality CAD

The goal of this repository is to allow people interested in advancing Augmented Reality through making a CAD application

## Goals
1. The first goal is to create functional graphics that allow for general objects to be created through Augmented Reality.
2. If the person is to look around, the object should not follow their field of vision. Like any normal object, it should remain in the      location of it's creation
3. If you go into another room, the CAD should not be visible, and should be able to be moved around through pushing/pulling the object     around the space
4. Upload to a virtual reality/augmented reality space (this will allow tools such as Oculus, Vive, or other VR/AR glasses to use the application in order to create objects from their imagination)

## Future Possible Goals
1. Create our own Augmented Reality Glasses
  - Ultimately our goal is to create a device of our own for the software to go on. We want the device to feel intuitive and wasy to use.
  
## Research
1. Look Up CAD Software
  - In order for users to more naturally be able to use the software, it should be similar to past software, taking the best feautres of CAD software in order to create the best CAD experience. 
2. Creating Augmented Reality
  - Currently we are planning to use Unity in order to created Augmented Reality images. However, we will need to research more on what is needed to be programmed in order to create the best software.
3. Creating an intuitive CAD software to be used by engineers that increases their productivity past what normal CAD would allow
